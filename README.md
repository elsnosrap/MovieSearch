# Overview

The code you submit for this exercise is intended as a starting point to help us better understand how you work through engineering problems. There is no preferred solution, but you’ll want to be able to walk us through your implementation and explain the technical choices you made.

You can solve this problem using any combination of Android libraries or technologies you’d like. Android Studio 3.+ is preferred. Demonstrating a solid understanding of object-oriented software development and architecture is more important than the specific languages or technologies used.

When we evaluate your submission we’ll be looking at general code quality and awareness of development patterns. Because our apps are quite extensive, it’s very important to us that candidates write code that is well modularized so it can easily be extended and built upon in the future -- even for an exercise. 

This exercise is not intended to take more than an evening, so please don’t take more than a few hours on this. In the ReadMe or code comments, you can address what additional steps you would take to improve your code if given unlimited time.

Please use a GitHub repo to share your response with us.

# Instructions

We’d like you to create an Android app that allows the user to search for a movie by title. The requirements are as follows:

Use OMDB movie database: https://www.omdbapi.com/

With this API Key: ee60b1cc

Display the results to the user, with at least the image of the movie poster (or any image provided by the api) and the title of the movie. There is no requirement for any persistence.

A future app is planned where you will have to use the same model from the api endpoint.


# ReadMe.md Requirements

Your repository should include a ReadMe.md file. Please take some time to write thoughtful answers, as it will help us understand your thought process and technical ability. Your ReadMe should answer the following questions:

- At a high level, how does your app work?
- What design decisions did you make and why?
- What design patterns or architecture might be necessary in the future?
- How would we extend your app if we had to add functionality?
- What documentation, websites, papers, etc. did you consult for this assignment?
- What third-party libraries or other tools does your application use? How did you choose each library or framework you used?
- How long did you spend on this exercise? If you had unlimited time to spend on this, how would you spend it and how would you prioritize each item?
- If you were going to implement a level of automated testing to prepare this for a production environment, how would you go about doing so?
